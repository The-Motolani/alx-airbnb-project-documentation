# Convert Your Use Case Diagram to User Stories

## User Stories

This directory contains the user stories for the Backend of the Airbnb Clone project.  
These user stories translate the system interactions (as modelled in the Use Case Diagram) into user-centric “As a … I want … so that …” statements.  

## 📁 Directory  

- `user-stories.md` — the main file listing all user stories.  
- (Future) Additional files may include:  
  - `user-stories-acceptance-criteria.md` — defining acceptance criteria for each story.  
  - `user-stories-epics.md` — grouping stories into larger epics.

## ✍️ Purpose  

The purpose of these user stories is to:  

- Capture system functionality from the **user’s perspective** (guests, hosts, admins).  
- Guide development by clarifying *who* wants *what* and *why*.  
- Serve as a foundation for backlog creation, sprint planning and testing.

## 📗 Format  

Each user story follows the format:  
> *As a **guest**, I want to register an account with email and password so that I can book properties and manage my future stays.*
> *As a **host**, I want to create and publish a new property listing with title, description, location, price and amenities so that I can attract guests and earn income from my property.*
> *As a **guest**, I want to search and filter listings by location, price range, number of guests and amenities so that I can find a property that fits my needs and budget quickly.*
> *As a **guest**, I want to book a property for specified start and end dates so that I can secure a reservation and see the total price before payment.*
> *As a **host**, I want to receive notification when a guest books my property and view the booking status so that I can prepare the property and ensure a smooth guest experience.*
