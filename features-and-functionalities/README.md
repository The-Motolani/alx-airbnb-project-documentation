# Project Requirements ‚Äì Airbnb Clone Backend

## üéØ Objective

Identification and documentation of the key features and functionalities of the Airbnb Clone backend by understanding the technical and functional requirements necessary for building a scalable, secure, and robust system.

## üìö Introduction to Project Requirements

Backend development involves creating the server-side logic, database management, and API integrations that power a web application. In this concept page, we will focus on the backend requirements for the Airbnb Clone project, emphasizing the key features that make the app functional, user-friendly, and efficient.

The requirements below are categorized into Core Functionalities, Technical Requirements, and Non-Functional Requirements.

### üîë Core Functionalities

The backend for the Airbnb Clone must enable key features that align with the functionalities of a rental marketplace.

#### 1. User Management

- **User Registration**

> - Allow users to sign up as guests or hosts.
> - Use secure authentication methods such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

- **User Login and Authentication**

> - Implement login via email and password.
> - Support optional OAuth sign-in (e.g., Google, Facebook).

- **Profile Management**

> - Enable users to update their profiles: profile photo, contact info, preferences.
> - Allow role-based differentiation (guest vs host vs admin).

#### 2. Property Listings Management

- **Add Listings**

> - Hosts can create property listings with details: title, description, location, price per night, amenities, availability.

- **Edit/Delete Listings**

> - Hosts can update or remove their property listings.

- **View Listings**

> - Guests can view listings with full details: description, images (if included later), amenities, host info.

#### 3. Search and Filtering

> - Implement search for properties by: location, price range, number of guests, amenities.
> - Provide filtering and sorting (e.g., by price, rating, availability).
> - Include pagination for large result sets.
> - Possibly support map-based search via geolocation (latitude/longitude).

#### 4. Booking Management

- **Booking Creation**

> - Guests can book a property for specified start and end dates.
> - Validate dates (no past dates, end date after start date).
> - Prevent overlapping bookings‚Äîensure availability for the property.

- **Booking Cancellation**

> - Allow guests or hosts (depending on policy) to cancel bookings.
> - Update status accordingly (pending ‚Üí confirmed ‚Üí canceled).

- **Booking Status Tracking**

> - Track statuses: pending, confirmed, canceled, completed.
> - Guests and hosts can view booking history, upcoming bookings.

#### 5. Payment Integration

> - Integrate with secure payment gateways (such as Stripe, PayPal).
> - Handle upfront payments by guests and payouts to hosts (or mark payment as complete).
> - Support multiple currencies (optional) and ensure correct currency handling.
> - Keep transaction records, payment status, payment method.

#### 6. Reviews and Ratings

> - Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties after stay.
> - Hosts can respond to reviews (if such functionality included).
> - Ensure reviews are linked to a specific booking to prevent abuse (guest must have completed stay).
> - Aggregate rating per property (average rating, number of reviews).

#### 7. Notifications System

> - Implement in-app notifications (and optionally email) for key events: booking confirmation, cancellation, payment success/failure.
> - For hosts: new booking request, booking confirmed/canceled, payment received.
> - For guests: booking status change, payment processed, review reminders.

#### 8. Admin Dashboard / Administration

> - Admin users can monitor and manage: users, listings, bookings, payments.
> - Admin can perform actions: deactivate user accounts, remove listings, view system reports.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements

### 1. Database Management

- Use a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) or other if chosen, but normalized to at least Third Normal Form (3NF).
- Required tables: Users (guests & hosts), Properties, Bookings, Payments, Reviews, (Messages if in scope).
- Use proper keys, constraints, indexes for performance.

### 2. API Development

- Use RESTful API endpoints (and optionally GraphQL for more complex queries).
- Use proper HTTP methods:
- GET: retrieve data
- POST: create data
- PUT/PATCH: update data
- DELETE: remove data
- Use appropriate status codes (200, 201, 400, 401, 403, 404, 500 etc).
- Provide versioning if needed (e.g., /api/v1/).
- Provide input validation, error handling, and consistent response formats (JSON).

### 3. Authentication & Authorization

- Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication.
- Role-based access control (RBAC): differentiate permissions for guests, hosts, admins.
- Protect endpoints: e.g., only hosts can create/edit listings; only the booking guest or host can cancel bookings; only admin can remove users/listings.

### 4. File Storage (Optional Scenario)

- For property images or user profile photos: store in cloud storage (AWS S3, Cloudinary) or local storage in dev environment.
- Store image metadata (URL, file name) in database.

### 5. Third-Party Services

- Email service: e.g., SendGrid or Mailgun for email notifications.
- Payment gateway SDKs: Stripe, PayPal.
- Logging & Monitoring: implement global error handling, logging of API requests, usage tracking.

## üöÄ Non-Functional Requirements

### Scalability

- Architecture designed in a modular way: routers/controllers/services separation.
- Support horizontal scaling: stateless API servers behind load balancer.
- Use caching (e.g., Redis) for commonly accessed data (search results, listings) to improve performance.

### Security

- Secure storage of sensitive data: passwords hashed (e.g., bcrypt), payment info encrypted or tokenized.
- Use HTTPS for all endpoints.
- Rate-limiting to prevent abuse.
- Input sanitization, protection against SQL injection, XSS, CSRF.
- Proper handling of authentication tokens, refresh tokens if used.

### Performance Optimization

- Use query optimization: indexes on frequently filtered/search columns (e.g., property location, price, availability).
- Caching for read-heavy endpoints.
- Pagination on list endpoints to reduce payload size.

### Testing

- Implement unit tests for services and controllers.
- Integration tests for API endpoints.
- Possibly end-to-end tests.
- Use CI/CD pipelines to automate tests and deployments.
