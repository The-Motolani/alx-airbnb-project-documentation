# Design a Flowchart for System Processes

## Flowcharts

This directory contains flowcharts representing the workflows and backend processes of the Airbnb Clone backend system.

## Objective

The purpose of these flowcharts is to visualize the logical sequence of operations and decision-making processes within key backend functionalities such as user registration, property booking, and payment processing.

## Current Flowchart

### **User Registration Process**

**File:** `user-registration-flowchart.png`

#### Description

This flowchart illustrates the process of user registration in the Airbnb Clone system. It details each step from initiating registration to successfully creating a user account.

#### Workflow Steps

1. **Start** — The user initiates the registration process.
2. **Submit Registration Form** — The user fills out and submits the registration form.
3. **Validate Input** — The system checks if all required fields are correctly filled.
4. **Check for Existing Email** — The system verifies whether the email is already registered.
5. **Hash Password** — If the email is unique, the password is securely hashed.
6. **Save User Data** — User information is stored in the database.
7. **Send Confirmation Email** — A confirmation message is sent to the user’s registered email address.
8. **End** — The user account is created successfully.

## Next Steps

Additional flowcharts will be added for:

- Property Listing Creation
- Booking Workflow
- Payment Processing
- Review and Rating Submission
